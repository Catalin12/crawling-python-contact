Rosemary Ritter,
https://www.atlasuhv.com/ -> 
We have decided to make an aluminum lid for the chamber you fabricated for us last winter, as well as a lid for one of our smaller chambers. We are very pleased with the quality of your chamber and would like to improve the vacuum for this entire system.
When I heard this morning, my immediate reaction was:  Damn those Atlas things are good!    We're off scale in the chamber with your multiple TSP's.    Might be able to say that we're in 13 scale vacuum......very nice!  You guys should go market the hell out of these... Congrats!
The tailpiece with Atlas Al window worked very well. It held vacuum and performed as we had hoped. We were able to get some very good low noise scattering data in just a few minutes using the high intensity of the NOMAD beam line. We're just now analyzing the data.
This addition (Atlas manufactured aluminum Loadlock Chamber) will significantly improve our processing time…
The Atlas chamber was delivered on time and is of very high quality workmanship, and is performing flawlessly.
Atlas was terrific to work with on our recent order of vacuum chambers. Communication from the production supervisor was proactive and ongoing throughout fabrication, the quality of work was outstanding, and delivery time was faster than expected.  Couldn't be more satisfied!
All the chambers have performed very well, met our specifications, and they were beautiful!
Atlas Technologies is one little diamond in a vast wasteland of good intentions, their bimetal and aluminum products and problems solving, is a very unique skill set that is so...valuable.

We have decided to make an aluminum lid for the chamber you fabricated for us last winter, as well as a lid for one of our smaller chambers. We are very pleased with the quality of your chamber and would like to improve the vacuum for this entire system.
When I heard this morning, my immediate reaction was:  Damn those Atlas things are good!    We're off scale in the chamber with your multiple TSP's.    Might be able to say that we're in 13 scale vacuum......very nice!  You guys should go market the hell out of these... Congrats!
The tailpiece with Atlas Al window worked very well. It held vacuum and performed as we had hoped. We were able to get some very good low noise scattering data in just a few minutes using the high intensity of the NOMAD beam line. We're just now analyzing the data.
This addition (Atlas manufactured aluminum Loadlock Chamber) will significantly improve our processing time…
The Atlas chamber was delivered on time and is of very high quality workmanship, and is performing flawlessly.
Atlas was terrific to work with on our recent order of vacuum chambers. Communication from the production supervisor was proactive and ongoing throughout fabrication, the quality of work was outstanding, and delivery time was faster than expected.  Couldn't be more satisfied!
All the chambers have performed very well, met our specifications, and they were beautiful!
Atlas Technologies is one little diamond in a vast wasteland of good intentions, their bimetal and aluminum products and problems solving, is a very unique skill set that is so...valuable.

There is no charge for the help of this personal shopper for anyone with a disability. Finally, your personal shopper will explain our Privacy Policy and Terms of Service, and help you place an order if you so desire.
